# digital-certificate-management-system

A web-based project for Persatuan Mahasiswa Sains Komputer (PERSAKA) in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).
COVID-19 has caused many UTM programs and activities to halts, including events organized by PERSAKA. Most of the events have been converted to online mode. This causes difficulty for PERSAKA because all the events provide certificates to the participants. They face some problems in issuing the certificate, waiting for the approval process, and emailing the certificates to the participants. Hence, the processs are inconvenience for them because they used to perform it manually and never done automatically. Therefore, this project aims to build a Digital Certificate Management System (DCMS) for PERSAKA where it allows them to generate digital certificates automatically in a short time. The methodology that has been implemented is Prototyping. The PERSAKA committees and developers are testing this system using the black-box testing technique. The result of the testing is recorded in the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) form.
